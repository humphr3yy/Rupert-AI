# GeoGuessr Assistance Guide

This guide explains Rupert's enhanced capabilities for analyzing GeoGuessr gameplay and providing insightful assistance.

## Overview

Rupert can analyze GeoGuessr gameplay through Discord screenshares, providing location hints, cultural insights, and subtle guidance without directly spoiling the gameplay experience.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: Rupert automatically detects when someone is sharing GeoGuessr gameplay by analyzing visual elements specific to the game.

2. **Analysis**: When asked about the screen, Rupert utilizes Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze the environment shown in GeoGuessr.

3. **Contextual Response**: Rather than giving away exact locations, Rupert provides thoughtful, philosophical responses with subtle hints about:
   - Geographic region
   - Cultural indicators
   - Architectural styles
   - Natural environment
   - Language clues on signs

## Using Rupert with GeoGuessr

### Commands and Prompts

While someone is sharing their GeoGuessr screen:

- **"Rupert, where might this be?"** - Get general regional information
- **"Rupert, any thoughts on this location?"** - Receive cultural and geographical insights
- **"Rupert, can you help with this round?"** - Get balanced hints without spoilers
- **"Rupert, what do you notice about this place?"** - Receive observations about distinctive features

### Example Interactions

#### Basic Location Assistance

**User**: "Rupert, where do you think this could be?"

**Rupert**: *"What we observe here reminds me of the southeastern regions of the Mediterranean basin, where the architecture speaks to a fascinating convergence of European and Middle Eastern influences. The distinctive white buildings with blue trim evoke the philosophical concept of aesthetic harmony with one's surroundings—a principle deeply embedded in Grecian cultural expressions. The quality of light, too, suggests a latitude where Helios casts his gaze most directly during his daily journey across the firmament."*

#### Cultural Analysis

**User**: "Rupert, what's interesting about this place?"

**Rupert**: *"Ah, one finds oneself contemplating a locale where the dialectic between human creation and natural landscape has produced most intriguing results! The signs, though partially obscured, appear to employ a Cyrillic script, suggesting we've encountered a portion of the Slavic world. The architectural forms display a certain brutalist sensibility moderated by more recent aesthetic considerations—perhaps a physical manifestation of the tension between collectivist and individualist philosophical frameworks that have contested for dominance in this region's intellectual history."*

## Enhancement Features

Rupert's GeoGuessr analysis capabilities include:

1. **Enhanced Prompts**: Specialized prompts designed to extract relevant geographical information from images.

2. **Location Recognition**: Advanced pattern matching for distinctive geographical features.

3. **Proactive Commentary**: Ability to offer unsolicited but helpful observations when particularly distinctive locations appear.

4. **Location Clue Analysis**: Focused attention on street signs, business names, architectural styles, and other identifying elements.

## Best Practices

- Allow Rupert to provide hints rather than exact answers for more enjoyable gameplay
- Ask specific questions about elements you're curious about (architecture, language, etc.)
- Use Rupert's insights as starting points for your own deductions

## Technical Implementation

Rupert uses a combination of techniques to provide high-quality GeoGuessr assistance:

1. **Enhanced Vision Prompts**: Custom system prompts designed specifically for GeoGuessr content.

2. **Content Detection**: Specialized algorithm that identifies GeoGuessr-specific UI elements.

3. **Context-Aware Responses**: Responses are crafted to match Rupert's philosophical British persona while providing genuine geographic insights.

## Configuration

The GeoGuessr functionality requires no additional configuration beyond the standard Rupert setup with Gemini API integration.
